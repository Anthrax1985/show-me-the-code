She had been shopping with her Mom in Wal-Mart. She must have been 6 years old, this beautiful brown haired,
freckle-faced image of innocence. It was pouring outside. The kind of rain that gushes over the top of rain gutters,
so much in a hurry to hit the Earth, it has no time to flow down the spout.
We all stood there under the awning and just inside the door of the Wal-Mart. We all waited, some patiently,
others irritated, because nature messed up their hurried day. I am always mesmerized by rainfall.
I get lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world. Memories of running,
splashing so carefree as a child come pouring in as a welcome reprieve from the worries of my day.
Her voice was so sweet as it broke the hypnotic trance we were all caught in, â€œMom, let's run through the rain."
she said.What? Mom asked.Let's run through the rain! She repeated.No, honey. We'll wait until it slows down a bit.
Mom replied.This young child waited about another minute and repeated: "Mom, let's run through the rain.
We'll get soaked if we do. Mom said.
